## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the year-to-date (YTD) sales, profit, order quantities, and market share of an e-commerce company operating in various regions and product categories. The goal was to create a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that offers insights into YTD sales performance across multiple dimensions, such as product categories and geographic markets. The dashboard enables stakeholders to track trends, identify underperforming areas, and make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies and improve profitability.

## Problem Statement 
The analysis aimed to address the following key questions:
1. How are the YTD sales and profits performing compared to the previous year?
2. Which product categories are leading in sales, and which are underperforming relative to the prior year?
3. What is the market share by sales across different geographic regions?
4. How does customer acquisition across regions trend month by month?
5. What insights can be drawn to optimize order quantities and improve profitability?

To answer these questions, the dashboard required visualizing data in the following formats:
- Line charts to show YTD trends in sales, profit, and order quantities over time.
- A bar chart comparing YTD category sales against the previous year’s sales.
- A pie chart representing market share by sales across different geographic regions.
- A ranking-style line chart to display monthly market customer acquisition trends per region.

## Analysis Results
1. **Sales Trends:** Total YTD sales reached $14.11M, reflecting a 4.80% increase compared to last year. Sales showed consistent performance but dipped significantly towards the end of the period.
2. **Profit Performance:** Total profit amounted to $1.30M, representing a slight decline of 0.46% compared to last year, largely due to a significant drop towards the period's end.
3. **Order Quantity:** Order quantity increased by 13.06% compared to the previous year, indicating growth in customer demand and engagement.
4. **Category Performance:** Cardio Equipment led with $2.34M in sales, while Fishing and Cleats experienced substantial declines (-24.98% and -26.34%, respectively). Water Sports was the best-performing category with a 21.10% YTD increase in sales.
5. **Market Share by Region:** LATAM commanded the largest market share at 45.86%, followed by Europe at 43.37%. Other regions, including Africa and USCA, contributed smaller portions of the overall sales.
6. **Customer Acquisition Trends:** LATAM maintained the top position in customer acquisition for most of the year, with Europe showing increased competitiveness. USCA consistently lagged behind other regions.

## Recommendations
1. **Address Underperforming Categories:** Product categories like Fishing, Cleats, and Apparel are underperforming compared to last year. A targeted approach, such as promotional discounts or revisiting product strategies, may help reverse the decline.
2. **Capitalize on High-Growth Regions:** LATAM and Europe represent the highest sales and customer acquisition figures. Further investment in these regions could help maintain market share dominance and fuel growth.
3. **Improve Profitability:** Despite an increase in sales and order quantities, profit margins have declined. The company should explore ways to reduce operational costs or adjust pricing to improve profitability.
4. **Expand in Underdeveloped Regions:** Regions like USCA and Africa show smaller market shares and fluctuating customer acquisition trends. Expanding marketing efforts and developing tailored strategies could help grow the customer base in these areas.

## Why It Matters
E-commerce businesses rely on understanding sales and customer acquisition trends to drive growth and stay competitive. This dashboard provides critical insights into YTD sales performance across categories and regions, helping stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions. By identifying areas of growth and underperformance, the business can optimize its strategies, expand into new markets, and improve profitability in a dynamic global market.
